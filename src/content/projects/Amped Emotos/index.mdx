# Introduction

Amped Emotos was a startup I was a founding engineer of. The goal of the company was to create a moto style bike
that was electric for both consumer and fleet vehivle applications. The company was started the summer of my sophomore year at 
UC erkeley, and was made up of a group of 10. There were 4 engineers (3 mechanical engineers and myself), 5 business people, 
and the CEO. The engineering team started completely from scratch and in 3 months was able to build a fully functioning 
prototype motorbike capable of 60 mph! We named the prototype Katara.

INSERT PIC OF FINAL PRODUCT

My role on the team was Chief Electrical Engineer and Computer Scientist - which meant I led the development of everything 
that had power going through it. I was the only EE or CS person on the team, so getting a fully functioning prototype working 
in 3 months was definetly a huge personal challenge and accomplishment. 

In this project post, I'm going to breakdown Katara's architecture and go into detail on the subsystems I lead the development of.

# Problem Statement: Build a protoype quickly & for cheap

The problem statement for the summer was to build a moto style bike that was capable of 

INSERT BUGDET BREAKDOWNS AND NEEDS


# Katara's Architecture

I joined this project with 2 years of experience on Formula Electric at Berkeley, because of that I tried to mimic that system 
as much as possible.

Katara was designed to be a distributed system with the cabality of simple expansion. This was acomplished by the use of CAN being
the main form of communication between nodes of the vehicle. CAN allows for an easy addition of nodes to a distributed system, and this
was essential for us. As the intention was to build baseline funcationlity first then gradually add more sensors and features as we went.

That being said there were a few main nodes of the system: Electronic Control Unit (ECU), Battery Management System (BMS), Motor Controller, 
and Data Control Unit (DCU). The system had a INSERT BATTERY SPEC, INSERT MOTOR, being controlled by a Blank motor controller

In the development of the initial prototype I was bottlnecked by a few things: manufacturing capabilities, small budget, and 
lack of engineering hours. As a result of these constraings, I decided very early on to buy as many things off the shelf
as possible for a first prototype.

{/* ## Mechanical Side

In the development of an initial prototype the the mechanical team was bottlenecked by manufacturing capabilities and cost. I think
these limiters really forced them to think outside of the box. 

For example, when designing the chassis we decided to go with a series of CNC's plates that were fastened together. This was a very 
unconventional way of designing a motorbike chasis, however 


 opposed to doing a tube style frame which would require a significant
a
bottleneck

# Conclusion

Although my only focus was on the engineering side of this project, this project definetly taught me how important the 
business side of a company is. That summer we built an amazing prototype that was perfect as a first step towards a real product.
However you can build a great product, but if the market doesn't need/want that product you end up just wasting your time. Sadly, in the
end Amped Emotos failed because the e bike market is so saturated, and not enough market research was done to confirm the niche
we were creating for actually existed. In the end, it was a great experience and I'm so happy to have been apart of such a fun and
motivated team!
