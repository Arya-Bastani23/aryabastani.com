# Introduction

[Formula Electric at Berkeley](https://ev.berkeley.edu/) is club at the University of California: Berkeley. The club has
roughly 80 members, and serves to educate it's members with real world engineering skills through building a car to
compete in the [SAE Formula EV competition](https://www.fsaeonline.com/). Every year the car is designed to be able to
carry a 5th percentile female to 95th percentile male and participate in a series of races: acceleration, endurance, and
autocross.

Fun fact the [fastest 0 to 60mph acceleration recorded by an electric car](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/14/1128923148/german-students-break-the-world-record-for-fastest-accelerating-electric-car-aga#:~:text=be%20long%20gone.-,The%20electric%20racing%20car%2C%20built%20by%2020%20University%20of%20Stuttgart,hour%20in%20just%201.461%20seconds.)
was set by FSAE competitor Green Team.

Formula Electric at Berkeley (FEB) was created in the Spring of 2020 from the remnants of the Berkeley Hyperloop Team. I
joined the team as a freshman the semester it was created. My freshman and sophomore year I developed the car's shutdown
circuit and my junior year I was HV PM. My senior year, I became EECS lead, responsible for managing 35 EECS students directly while simultaneously
working with the ME lead to organize the full 90 person team. I worked with sponsors to attain funding, create timelines,
review all EECS designs, and decide overall car design.

**In my year serving as Chief EECS Engineer FEB developed it's second car (SN2), the first one to drive and be fully
fuctioning. I will focus on that car in this post.**

**Disclaimer!! A lot of the components broken down below I did not personally design, but gave guidance, reviewed, and made sure
worked properly as a full system. SN2 would be a pile of garbage without the great team behind it and SN1. I will do my
best to give credit to goons that led these projects as they come up!**

INSERT FULL TEAM PICTURE

# Problem Statement: FSAE EV

Since 1981, each year Formula SAE releases a new 150 page rule book for the same general competition. The competition revolves around teams building a
formula style racing car to compete in a series of dynamic events: 1/4 mile acceleration, skipad, autocross, brake test,
efficiency, and endurance. In addition, to dynamic events the competition consists of static events: design and business events. These
secondary events serve to ensure cars are created with proper engineering and business first principles, in a reproducable
manner like a car OEM.

# SN2 Architecture

SN2 was designed with the goal to be rule complaint, manufacturable, safe, and to finish an endurance race. It had a 571.2V
battery pack with a maximum power output of 80kW - approximately 110 horsepower. SN2 ran a single Emrax 228 motor with a
rhinehart PM100DZ inverter. The car had a decentralized computing system, where nodes - moslty made of custom PCB's architected
around the STM32F446 microcontrollers - communicated with eachother over a CAN bus. SN2 had an interactive driver heads up display,
datalogging, and a telemetry system that fed data to a pit GUI. This allowed us to make data driven decisions in order
to improve SN2 and prepare for SN3.

# Accumulator (AKA High Voltage Battery)

![Accumulator Side](./images/accumulator_side.png)

![Accumulator B&W](./images/accumulator_black_and_white.png)

The accumulators is the heart of the car, without SN2 would be a glorified shopping cart. That being said it was also the most
difficult part of the car on the EECS side to prototype, design, and build. Building a functional accumulator is a true test of
safety and good engineering practices, 9/10 times it's where FSAE teams fail.

SN2's accumulator was broken up into two piece: the attic and segments housing. The segments housing was where the actual battery
cells were, and the attic was where all of the safeguards and logic of the acculumator was.

## The Segments Housing

## The Cells

SN2's accumulator was a 571.2V battery pack capable of 80kW of discharge. The pack was comprised of
[energus modules](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13J72bW00z5FcrS1s2J84LHX0J47q02Jx/view?usp=sharing) made from Samsung 18650 cells.
The modules were made of 4 18650 cells put in parallel, each module had 10Ah and 3.8 nominal voltage. The great part about these modules
interfaced with bus bars with built in skrew threads, requiring no spot welding. In addition to this they had built in temperature
sensors that were simple to connect with using a molex connection. The only problem with these modules were that they were very difficult
to package: you can't take advantage of how cylindrical cells can lock together resulting in an overal larger battery size.
The reason we chose these modules are because they did not require any spot welding, and the temperature sensors were built in.

![Battery Module](./images/energus_module.png)

## Segments

The accumulator had a few levels of "battery abstraction". The lowest level was called the "cell" this was the actual cylindrical Samsung
18650 batteries, the next was the "module" which were the energus modules that put 4 of those 18650's in parallel allowing for 10Ah of discharge.
The modules were still low voltage, we would put 17 of them in series in order to build up to a nominal voltage of 64.6V. We would call this
HV set of modules a "segment". Finally we would put 8 segments in series to create the final "accumulator". The reason we split up the accumulator
like this is due to safety. HV is dangerous, so by splitting the pack up, if something goes wrong the amount of energy that you're dealing with is smaller.

![Battery Module](./images/segment_side.png)

The segment was comprised of the energus modules, Batter Management System Daughter and Aux boards (I will cover this later), bus bars, and caps. They
were designed in order to be easy to assemble, safe, and extremely compact. I would say they they were safe and extremely compact. The way
this was accomplished was by realizing that the insulation that was already installed on the modules satisfied FSAE's rules requirements so we did not
need to add any additional material on the sides, all we needed were caps to protect the bus bars and BMS boards that were stacked on top of the modules.
In between the modules and the packs was the BMS daughterboard and aux boards which was great for packaging

INSERT SEGMENT STACK PIC

I thought this was a great idea initially, however it was in the end very difficult to assemble the segment requiring one to readjust a segment being
aseembled constantly in order to get a different angle to install a bus bar, temp sensor, etc. An adverse affect of this was that if any stress was
put on the green insulation of the modules they would tear, and moving the segments around so much during assembly would cause this to happen quiet often.

INSERT SEGMENT ASSEMBLY PIC

In addition to the difficultly of assembly, these caps made it essentially impossible to debug the BMS boards on the segments once the caps were installed.
They completely covered the system and didn't allow for any probing to be done and all the indicator LEDs were covered. So anytime a problem was found the
entire segment needed to be disassembled.

INSERT SAD SEGMENT DEBUGGING PIC

My final note about the segments is that working with them truly allowed me to appreciate the dangers of HV. It is not something to be played with and
should be respected for its ability to do real permanent damage to a person. As a result I made this HV safety tutorial that I thought would be good to
make open source. Below is a result of a close call we had when dealing with segment testing. NEVER RUSH and ALWAYS have an exact plan when dealing with
HV systems.

INSERT BLOWN UP MODULE PIC

## Intersegment Connections

One of the great mechanical advances that was made in SN2's battery pack was the intersegment connection. In the previous year we used
[radlock connectors](https://www.amphenol-industrial.de/en/Radlok-Connectors), which I love for prototyping and testing idea. However for real use in
an FSAE vehicle, they package very poorly and require a lot of force to remove which causes problems when working with them in a small battery pack.

This was due to the fact they took fully insulated wiring as an input - insulation adds a lot of volume compared to a bare bus bar or wire, and you cannot
do 90 deg or shart turns with wire.

INSERT PIC OF RADLOCKS BEING BAD

For we used bus bars with moles pins on the ends of them in order to do intersegment connections. Bus bars are great for packaging because you make their
internal surface area whatever you want to meet your packaging needs, and they can be made to go in different angles very easily. It is all up to your
imagination and machining capability.

INSERT PIC OF BUSBARS

The way the bus bar interfaced with the segments was simply with a molex pin and socket that was spec'd for high current and voltage applications. There was
no locking on the pin which allowed for easy installation and removal. However it is important to have some sort of "positive locking" in the system so vibrations
of the car don't cause the bus bars to come out and cause issues. The way we achieved this "positive locking" was the lid of the pack went directly onto the bus bars
and pressed down on them so there was no way that they could get jostled out. The bus bars had properly spec'd heat shrink everywhere but the pin connection and
the pack lid had a thick layer of insulating foam, so there was no chance of the metal lid shorting the system.

INSERT PIC OF SYSTEM AND ALSO COMP PICS

## BBB: Big Battery Board

The Big Battery Board AKA the BBB was the brain of SN2's accumulator. It was responsible for handling all information pertaining to the accumulator, sending
pertinant info to the rest of the car, making sure the battery was in a safe condition, and shutting of the system if it wasn't.

This board was made out of a hatred for harnessing born from working on SN1's pack. Inside SN1's attic there was 5 custom PCBS's: BMS Mother Board, HV Indicator
Light Driver, IMD Driver, Precharge Circuit, HV Fusing. After realizing that each board had almost the same inputs and outputs, we decided to consolidate
them all into a single board called the BBB, which reduced the time and complexity of harnessing exponentially!

INSERT BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURE

A huge additional benefit of integrating all these boards on a single system with a microcontroller is that if one fails we can both have an indicator light
and send a failure message over CAN to indicate where the shutdown cicuit was initiated from. Shoutout Nikhil Ograin for making this thing so well!

## BBB: BMS

The BMS had a 3 level architecture: mother board, daughter board, and aux board.

INSERT DIAGRAM

## BMS Mother Board

The mother board was the orchestrator of the system. It would control all the daughter boards, communicate the state of the battery to the rest of the car,
ensure the battery stays in an acceptable voltage range and temperature, and shutdown the system if it was in a dangerous state. All things considered the
motherboard was essentially a microcontroller with the correct break out to read and control outside components. It would take in the isoSPI signal from the
cells convert it to CAN and communicate the info to the rest of the car. In addition if anything was unsafe it was a part of the shutdown loop and would
begin shutdown if needed.

INSERT BMS MOTHER BOARD SCHEMATIC

## BMS Daughter Board

The daughter boards design was centered around the LTC6811-1, it was a great solution for our needs. The chip is is capable of measuring cell voltage, enable cell discharge,
GPIO, ADC, and isolated communication for 5-12 battery cells. The reason we used two of these chips on each aux board is because they were only capable of up to managing 12
cells and we had 17 modules in each segment. They interfaced with the aux board through a pin connection like an arduino shield.

INSERT PIC OF TWO DAUGHTER BOARDS ON AUX BOARD

Once we had this IC we just need to figure out a way to give it power, and how to get them to work with our temp
sensors. For the most part we followed the recommended exmample given in it's data sheet. To power the chip we used an LT3990 buck converter that dropped down HV
from the segments to 5V, again not really changing much from the schematic. The LTC6811-1 only had 5 GPIO pins and only two of them were 2 ADC pins. So we would not be able to feed in all the temp sensor
data directly into it. To tackle this we used two 1:8 MUX that would take each read the same temperature signals and send them to both ADC pins. We controlled the mux
with the remaining 3 GPIO pins 2^3 = 8, so you command 8 different signals.

INSERT DAUGHTERBOARD SCHEMATIC AND

Additionally this setup required minimal harnessing, because iso-SPI allowed all the daughter boards to be daisy chained together.

## BMS Auxillary Board

The Auxillary boards served to essnetially gather all the signals needed by the daughter boards, and also hold the cell balancing transistors and resistors. For each
module the segment had 4 components that were repeated across the board: temp sensor driver, fusing, RC filter on voltage, and balancing circuit. The ladder were combinded into
a single circuit block in design.

INSERT FULL AUX BOARD PICTURE

The temperature signal outputted by the energus module was from a temperature sensitive diode. So we needed to provide a voltage and then measure
the forward voltage of the diode, here we do that with the 5V and 680V resistor. From there we just have an RC filter to have a stable output as it'll
go directly to the daughter board.

INSERT PICTURE OF TEMP sensor

The cell balancing sub circuit has an input fuse that will protect the rest of the system if the module shorts. The RC filter on the voltage ensures a stable
signal as this gets fed straight into the daughterboard. Then there's the actual balancing circuit, which is just a P-MOS that acts as a switch connected to
a resistor. Whenever you need to bleed voltage of a module the daughter board will control this to close the loop of the module with the resistor. The LED is just
there as an indicator for when we're doing balancing.

INSERT BALANCING

## BBB: E meter
In order to measure the full HV voltage and current on the system we were presented with two options. Build systems that could do these functions, or get an off the 
shelf solution. We found the [IVT S-Series Current Sensor](https://www.isabellenhuetteusa.com/product/ivt-s-series/). It was a solution that perfectly fit our use case 
and would save us many engineering hours, so we opted to use it over a fully custom solution. It worked great, it had a high current measurement sensor and 2 HV capable 
voltage sensors and would automatically send it's measurements over CAN. All it needed from the BBB was power. The BMS would use this sensore to inform battery safety and
since the sensor was built so well we never had any issues and could truly trust the battery was safe.

INSERT IVT PIC

### BBB: HV LIGHT
Per FSAE rules 

### BBB: Isolation Monitoring Device (IMD) Driver
FSAE (very wisely) also required all teams to include all teams to have an isolation monitoring device in their battery that would test for isolation between HV ground and 
LV ground in the car. For safety reasons and per the rules they were required to be isolated. FSAE didn't trust teams to spec or design a sensor to test for this isolation,
they just made all teams use the [Bender ISOMETER® IR155-3203/IR155-3204](https://www.bender.de/fileadmin/content/Products/d/e/IR155-32xx-V004_D00115_D_XXEN.pdf). Looking back
on it, the sensor was pretty neat. Doing everything analogue, it would create pulses of 150V potential difference between LV and HV ground. Then it would measure voltage difference
between the two during the pulses and confirm they looked alright. Based on this the sensors sends out a binary yes/no on if there are no isolation faults. The yes/no signal is
sent as a voltage of Vdd-2 for yes and 0V for no. We drop this down to 3.3 volts and compare it to a hard coded 1.5V to check if there's any isolation faults. If there are faults
we open the shutdown circuit. In addition we have an SR latch in the system to make sure that the shutdown circuit can't be closed again until it's reset. This is for safety, as
there is a scenario were you can have isolation faults intermittently, but you want to shut down the system immediately after the first one for good.

INSERT IMD DRIVER SCHEMATIC

{/* ### BBB: HV -> LV Power Converter */}

## Accumulator Isolation Relays: AIRs
These are pretty much just big switches. These go in between the output of the battery and the rest of the car, one on HV + and one on HV -. When the car is ready to drive after 
all the safety checks happen these switches close and power can flow out of the battery to the rest of the car. The whole point of the shutdown circuit is to open these switches
when something goes wrong in the car. The AIR's are simple but important.

INSERT AIR PIC

## Fan and Fan Drivers
Sadly cooling was an after thought on SN2. We had no simulations to back up any claims we had. But, we knew that adding fans could only help our system be more efficient (for the most part).
Following this trian of thought we slapped 12 [Sanyo Denki 9WPA0624P4G001](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sanyo-denki-america-inc/9WPA0624P4G001/13170607) fans on the thing and
called it a day. We split them up into 4 groups of 3, each group was controlled individually using 4 125kHz PWM signals. Each fan also had a tachnometer, which would return a signal
that showed how fast the fan was actually spinning, we used this to create a closed loop system to get fans to go the exact speed we wanted them to. 

INSERT FAN SCHEMATIC PIC

In the end, right before competition we removed the fans from the accumulator and sealed all the holes due to concerns over water proofing. So this system was never tested beyond the bench.

# Electrical Engineering

The Electrical Engineering team handled all EE tasks of the car outside of the accumulator. From a program management stand point this split helped with team managemment significantly. If the
accumulator of the car it's heart, the EE team was in charge of delevoping the car's nervous system and motor function. It designed the systems to take in all the sensory input of the car, 
analyze it, and then either: store, display, or use that induce/adjust movement from the car. This subteam worked closely with the CS subteam in integration hell, getting all the sub systems to
work together like an orchestra.

## APPS

## BSPD

## Shutdown Circuit

## Pre-charge and Discharge

The purpose of the pre-charge and discharge circuit was for pure safety. The reason they're needed is due to the large capacitors in the motor controller.
Once the car is ready to drive the motor controller gets connected to the battery, and once that happens the capacitors in the motor controller will
charge to the same voltage as the battery pack. 

The way the precharge system works is that once the car is ready to drive, before you close the main AIRs you on the + side you close a different line
with a large resistance on it. 

INSERT PICTURE

What this does is that it reduces the amount of current capable of going through the system, making it so the capacitor in the motor controller slowly
reaches the same voltage as the battery pack. Then using the IVT current and voltage sensor we can measure the capacitor voltage of the motor controller
and close the main + AIR once it reaches 90% of the main pack voltage. 

The reason the precharge is there is due to INSERT MATH I DON'T WANNA DO IT ON THE PLANE, once you connect the battery and motor controller there will
be a large in rush of current going to the motor controller. This is really bad, as this large current surge could potentially fuse the contactors in
the AIR's we talked about above. The whole point of the AIRs are that they're supposed to open when the car's unsafe, but if they're welded together
due this can't happen. In addition the inrush of current can also generate enough EMI to break other commponents in or around the motor controller. 

The way the discharge works is essentially the same way the precharge system works. Once we turn the car off, we connect the + side of the motor controller'S
power input to a resistor that's connected to ground. What this does is it drains all the excess voltage from the motor controller capacitor and bleeds it 
through the resistor till it reaches 0V.

INSERT PICTURE

Now the reason for the discharge circuit is that if we were to leave the motor controller without discharging it if someone were to touch it's + and -
inputs they would be shocked with HV. This would be really bad, and potentially fatal. So we drain all that energy through a resistor so there's no safety
concern and you can handle the motor controller with ease of mind.
