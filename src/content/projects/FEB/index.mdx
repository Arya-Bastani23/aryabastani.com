# TLDR;

- Oversee/manage the design, implementation, and manufacturing of electric and software systems of a Formula SAE race car
- Manage a team of 35 designing more than 20 custom PCBs and custom firmware to create an electric race car with an 80kW
  powertrain, active telemetry system, and pit interface capable of going 80 mph while carrying a human safely
- Optimize performance of system to inverter efficiently supply maximum amount of power without overheating battery of car
- Project lead of low voltage power distribution board and ground station software/interface in previous years
- Designed all hardware and firmware from scratch for a PCB switching between two power inputs supplying power to low
  voltage systems, tracks power draw data of systems, and communicates through CAN using a STM32F446 microcontroller

# Introduction

[Formula Electric at Berkeley](https://ev.berkeley.edu/) is club at the University of California: Berkeley. The club has
roughly 80 members, and serves to educate it's members with real world engineering skills through building a car to
compete in the [SAE Formula EV competition](https://www.fsaeonline.com/). Every year the car is designed to be able to
carry a 5th percentile female to 95th percentile male and participate in a series of races: acceleration, endurance, and
autocross.

Fun fact the [fastest 0-60mph recorded by an electric car](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/14/1128923148/german-students-break-the-world-record-for-fastest-accelerating-electric-car-aga#:~:text=be%20long%20gone.-,The%20electric%20racing%20car%2C%20built%20by%2020%20University%20of%20Stuttgart,hour%20in%20just%201.461%20seconds.)
was set by FSAE competitor Green Team.

# Problem Statement: Destination Deep Space

Each year [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/) reveals a new game and give a 6 week design period for teams to
prototype, design, and build an industrial sized robot. Each game requires 2 alliances, comprised of 3 robots each,
to compete against eachother to achieve certain goals, score more points, and ultimately win 2.5 min long
matches.

In 2019 the goal of the game, [Destination: Deep Space](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2019/Manual/2019FRCGameSeasonManual.pdf),
was to fill two "rockets" with large rubber balls called "fuel". However, the fuel would fall out of the
rockets unless their exit holes are covered with circular polycarbonate "hatch panels". In the final 30
seconds of the match there was an end game task of climbing onto a platform 1.5 feet off the ground.
